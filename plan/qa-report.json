  "report": "## Issues Identified\n\n- **Invalid HTML structure in `CallToAction` component**: A `<Link>` (anchor) is nested inside a `<button>`, which is not valid HTML and can cause accessibility and clickâ€‘target problems. The button should either be replaced by a styled `<Link>` or the click handling should be moved to the button.\n- **Unused state in `Navbar` component**: The `useState` hook (`isOpen` and `setIsOpen`) is declared but never used, leading to dead code and a minor performance/clarity issue.\n- **Missing `type` attribute on button**: The `<button>` in `CallToAction` lacks a `type=\"button\"` attribute, which could unintentionally submit forms if the component is ever placed inside a `<form>`.\n- **Potential SEO improvement**: No `<title>` tags or meta description elements are set for each page. While not strictly a bug, adding them would better follow the SEO guidance.\n- **Inconsistent navigation label**: Footer links label the home page as \"Hero\". Typically the home page is labeled \"Home\"; this may confuse users.\n\nThese issues are relatively minor and do not break core functionality, but fixing them will improve code quality, accessibility, and alignment with best practices.",
