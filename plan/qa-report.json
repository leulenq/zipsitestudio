  "issues_found": true,
  "report": "- **Incorrect `'use client'` directive**: All files use `use client;` instead of the required string literal `'use client';`, causing a syntax error.\n- **Wrong import paths**: Pages and layout import components with `../../../components/...` but the correct relative path from `app/...` is `../../components/...`. This will break module resolution for every page and the layout.\n- **Incorrect Image import**: `import { Image } from 'next/image';` is invalid; `Image` is the default export and should be imported as `import Image from 'next/image';`.\n- **Unused/duplicate navigation component**: Both `Navbar.tsx` and `NavigationBar.tsx` exist, but only `NavigationBar` is used (and incorrectly). `Navbar` is dead code.\n- **NavigationBar styling deviates from brand**: Uses background `#0047AB` instead of the primary brand color `#3498db`.\n- **Footer component misuse of Image**: Because of the wrong import, the logo image will not render.\n- **Missing SEO elements**: No `<title>` or meta description tags are set for any page.\n- **CallToAction component never used**: Exists but isn’t referenced anywhere, adding unnecessary bundle size.\n- **Link usage inconsistency**: `NavigationBar` uses `next/navigation` `Link` without a leading slash for the home link (`href=\"\"`), which could resolve incorrectly.\n- **Missing required Contact Form integration**: While `ContactForm` is rendered, the `ContactSection` already contains contact info; the plan expects a single contact page combining both, but the layout separates them—still acceptable but could be streamlined.\n- **Styling not fully aligned with brand palette**: Secondary color `#f1c40f` is used only in the pricing table header, but primary color usage is inconsistent across navigation and other elements.\n- **Potential accessibility issues**: Buttons lack `aria-label`s, and form inputs lack associated `<label>` `htmlFor` attributes.\n- **Component file naming mismatch**: The plan calls for a \"Navigation Bar\" component, but the code provides both `Navbar` and `NavigationBar`; this redundancy may cause confusion.\n\nOverall, the code fails to compile and does not fully adhere to the plan or brand brief.",
