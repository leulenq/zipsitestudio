  "report": "## Issues Detected\n\n- **Missing required Hero layout**: The plan specifies a *Hero* page with an **Introduction** section and a **Call to Action** (Contact Us form). The root `page.tsx` renders `Introduction` and `ContactForm`, but the dedicated `CallToAction` component is never used, so the Call‑to‑Action button is missing.\n\n- **Brand palette not respected**: The brand brief defines primary `#4567b7` and secondary `#6495ed`. The code uses unrelated colours (`#3498db`, `#0047AB`, `#f1c40f`, etc.) throughout navigation, buttons, and tables, violating the brand guidelines.\n\n- **Incorrect Image import in Footer**: `import { Image } from 'next/image';` should be `import Image from 'next/image';`. The current import will cause a runtime error.\n\n- **Wrong Link import in NavigationBar**: `import { Link } from 'next/navigation';` is incorrect for a client component. It should be `import Link from 'next/link';`. Additionally, the `href` values lack leading slashes (e.g., `href=\"services\"` should be `href=\"/services\"`).\n\n- **Unused / duplicate components**: \n  - `CallToActionButton` is defined but never used.\n  - `Navbar` component is defined but never referenced; the app uses `NavigationBar` instead, causing unnecessary code bloat.\n\n- **SEO metadata missing**: The plan calls for optimizing the Contact Us page for keywords, yet no `<Head>` component or meta tags are present to provide SEO information.\n\n- **Potential accessibility issue**: The contact form uses a plain `<Input>` for the message field instead of a `<textarea>`, which is less suitable for multi‑line input.\n\n- **Responsive design not evident**: No responsive utilities (media queries, flex/grid, or responsive Chakra UI props) are applied, so the requirement for a responsive design is not demonstrably met.\n\n- **Inconsistent component naming**: Both `NavigationBar` and `Navbar` exist, which can cause confusion for future maintenance.\n\n## Summary\nThe code includes many extra pages/components that are not required by the plan, and several implementation mistakes prevent it from fully matching the specifications.\n\n**Overall score:** 4",
