  "report": "### Issues Identified\n\n1. **Incorrect Image import in `HeroSection.tsx`**\n   ```tsx\n   import { Image } from 'next/image';\n   ```\n   `next/image` exports a default component. It should be:\n   ```tsx\n   import Image from 'next/image';\n   ```\n\n2. **Invalid/empty `href` for Home link in `NavigationBar.tsx`**\n   ```tsx\n   <Link href=\"\">Home</Link>\n   ```\n   An empty string does not navigate to the home page. Use `/` instead:\n   ```tsx\n   <Link href=\"/\">Home</Link>\n   ```\n\n3. **Relative `href` values in the main page (`app/page.tsx`)**\n   ```tsx\n   <Link href=\"services\">Services</Link>\n   ```\n   When using the App Router, links should be absolute (start with `/`). Otherwise the navigation may resolve incorrectly.\n   ```tsx\n   <Link href=\"/services\">Services</Link>\n   ```\n   Apply the same fix to About, Contact, and Pricing links.\n\n4. **`PricingTable` component is never used**\n   - The pricing page only renders `<PricingSection />`. To meet the requirement of a *pricing table*, import and render `<PricingTable />` inside `PricingSection` or directly in `pricing/page.tsx`.\n\n5. **Multiple unused navigation components**\n   - `Navbar.tsx` and `Navigation.tsx` are defined but never imported anywhere. This adds dead code and can be confusing. Remove them or replace the current navigation with a single, consistent component.\n\n6. **Duplicate content components**\n   - Both `About.tsx`/`AboutSection.tsx`, `Services.tsx`/`ServicesSection.tsx`, and `Contact.tsx`/`ContactSection.tsx` exist with almost identical markup. Keep only one version (prefer the `*Section` variants that are already used) to avoid redundancy.\n\n7. **Missing mobile‑friendly navigation**\n   - The navigation bars lack a hamburger menu or any responsive handling. This does not satisfy the *mobile‑friendly navigation* requirement.\n\n8. **SEO gaps**\n   - No `<title>` or meta description tags are set for any page. Header hierarchy (H1, H2) is present, but without proper `<head>` management the SEO guidance is not fully met.\n\n9. **`use client` on layout component**\n   - `app/layout.tsx` is declared as a client component (`use client`). Layouts are usually server components; making it a client component unnecessarily increases bundle size.\n\n10. **Styling consistency**\n    - The navigation bar in `Navbar.tsx` uses a hard‑coded background color `#0047AB` which does not match the brand primary color `#3498db`. Align colors with the brand palette.\n\n### Summary\nThe project contains most required pages and components, but several functional bugs, unused/duplicate code, and missing responsive/SEO implementations cause it to deviate from the original plan and brand brief.\n\n---\n**Score:** 5",
