  "report": "## Issues Detected\n\n- **Missing core UI components**: The pages (`app/page.tsx`, `app/about/page.tsx`, `app/contact/page.tsx`, `app/services/page.tsx`, `app/pricing/page.tsx`) import components `Hero`, `About`, `Contact`, `Services`, and `Pricing` that are not defined anywhere in the codebase.\n- **Duplicate navigation components**: Both `Navbar.tsx` and `NavigationBar.tsx` exist, but only `NavigationBar` is used. `Navbar` is dead code and creates confusion.\n- **Brand color mismatch**: `Navbar.tsx` uses an inline background color `#0047AB` which does not match the brand primary color `#3498db`. `NavigationBar` has no styling, so the site does not reflect the brand palette.\n- **SEO deficiencies**:\n  - No meta description or keyword tags in `layout.tsx` (only a generic `<title>`).\n  - No header tags (`<h1>`, `<h2>`, etc.) in any component (the missing Hero/Services/etc. would likely contain them).\n  - No images are present, but the guidance to add `alt` attributes is not demonstrated.\n- **Contact form quality**: Labels are not associated with inputs via `htmlFor`/`id`, inputs lack `name` attributes, and there is no form validation or submit handling.\n- **Call‑to‑Action styling**: `CallToAction.tsx` renders a plain button without any styling that reflects the brand colors or typography.\n- **Pricing table styling**: `PricingTable.tsx` is a plain HTML table with no styling to apply the secondary (`#f1c40f`) or accent (`#e74c3c`) colors.\n- **Footer year**: Footer shows `© 2024` while the current year is 2025; minor but inconsistent.\n- **Layout HTML structure**: The root `<html>` element lacks a `lang` attribute (e.g., `lang=\"en\"`) and does not follow the recommended Next.js app router structure for accessibility.\n\nThese issues cause the implementation to diverge from the original plan and brand brief.",
